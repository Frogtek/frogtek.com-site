            <h3 class="font-weight-light">The problem</h3>
            <p>
                Our first set of customers are the "mom-and-pop" shops that dot many corners in Latin America
                and
                the
                rest of the developing world. Despite selling hundreds if not thousands of different products,
                most of
                these micro-retailers do not track their sales or expenses because they cannot afford a cash
                register
                or other point-of-sales tool. The most organized shopkeepers may record some transactions in a
                notebook and then laboriously transfer this information to a spreadsheet but they generally
                still
                do
                not have a clear idea about how to use this data to improve profits.
            </p>

            <p>
                The end result is that most of these businesses do not know their break-even sales, cannot
                analyze
                an
                investment opportunity, nor optimize their purchasing decisions. All of these limitations
                combine
                to
                keep micro-retailers operating in a sub-optimal manner, reducing profits, limiting growth and
                making
                life more difficult for their suppliers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-light">The Solution</h3>
            <p>

                Our first product is a <a href="http://www.tiendate.mx/" target="_blank">point-of-sale
                software
                application </a>that allows micro-retailers to record all store expenses and revenues directly
                on
                a
                mobile phone or tablet; an external bar code reader connected to the phone via a wireless
                connection
                allows them to record transactions at the product level. In exchange micro-retailers gain
                access
                to
                financial reporting, personalized recommendations and additional value-added services.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of our software applications run on Android smart phones or tablets that have touch
                screens
                and
                synchronize wirelessly with our Web servers.
            </p>
