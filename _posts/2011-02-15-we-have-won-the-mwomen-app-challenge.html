<p>Today at the Mobile World Congress awards ceremony our CTO Guillermo picked up the award for the best smartphone application that benefits women at the Base Of the Pyramid. As you can see in the picture, the award comes with a generous check of $10,000.</p>

<p>We participated in the <a href="mwomen.mobileappchallenge.com">online challange</a>, competing with a total of 63 entries from all over the world. You can see the video we prepared to describe our application <a href="http://mwomen.mobileappchallenge.com/entries#93233">here</a>.</p>
<p>Other than the great recognition and funds, we'll get special access to Carmel, a venture capital firm, and to Frog Design, a design consultancy.</p>
<p>So THANK YOU so much GSMA!! And special thanks go to Vodafone, Guillermo's and my former employer, who sponsored the challenge.</p>
