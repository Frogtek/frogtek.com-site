<p>Today Echoing Green announced the newest class of <a href="http://2010fellows.echoinggreen.org/">fellows for 2010</a>. They are 16 new nonprofit, for-profit, and hybrid organizations in the fields of human rights, health, the environment, and education, among other fields. And they were chosen from a pool of 1,000 applicants from 73 countries, that's some serious competition!</p>
<p>I attended the finalist event in New York, where some of the new fellows gave their 1 minute pitch to an audience of more than five hundred people. It was a great experience to hear directly from them about all those great ideas. And it was humbling for me to realize yet again what a great community we are part of. Happy to see all this talent coming to help make the world a better place!</p>
