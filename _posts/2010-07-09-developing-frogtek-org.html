<p>Today the tech team <a href="http://developing.frogtek.org/">has started a blog</a> to tell the story of building a high-tech product for low-income customers. It'll be quite techie and in Spanish, focused on Agile techniques, quality assurance, kanban boards, test-driven development and so forth.</p>
<p>Hopefully they will inspire other top software engineers to tackle the many problems at the Base of the Pyramid that can be solved or at least alleviated with smartphones and Internet applications. They sure have inspired me with their first post!</p>
