<p>The Android team at Google has just produced a video that shows the growth of new activations of Android phones throughout the world. It's very impressive to see how from a trickle in late 2008, users are now coming to the platform in floods, in particular after the Motorola Droid came out. You can even see how the major urban centers like New York or Paris are the first ones to adopt, followed by smaller cities.</p>

<p>Of course, the action right now is mostly taking place in the richer countries. But you can already see a nice amount of activity in Latin America, most of Asia and even Africa. The question is, when will the trickle there take off. What phone will play the role of the Droid in Mexico, for instance?</p>
<p>But there is no question that the flood is coming and that raises the hope to quickly close the digital divide. At Frogtek we are extremely excited and will be expecting it with excellent apps for the Base of the Pyramid.</p>
