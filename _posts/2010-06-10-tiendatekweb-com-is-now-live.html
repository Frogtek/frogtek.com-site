<p>For the last few weeks we have been working on a website for our Tiendatekweb product. We wanted it to show the features of the product but also be simple and lean to facilitate downloads from low-bandwidth connections. It also had to provide a way for interested shopkeepers to contact us.</p>
<p>So after a bit of work, here you have it: <a href="http://tiendatekweb.com/">http://tiendatekweb.com/</a></p>
<div ><a href="http://tiendatekweb.com/" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/logo.png" /></a></div>
<p>In the near term we will add a blog for shopkeepers, a customer support forum and access to financial reports for each shopkeeper. Lots of work still to go!</p>
<p>Please feel free to give us your feedback, it is always welcome!</p>
