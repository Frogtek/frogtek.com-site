<p>Today five centuries and some years ago, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> completed a remarkable journey that connected two continents and radically shaped our ensuing history, both for good and bad. After such a feat, he became a legendary figure revered and hated alike. But if you look closely, you can see all the elements of a fantastic entrepreneurial story.</p>
<p>Let's start with his industry, that of exploration, conquest and colonization of Atlantic islands. In the two decades years before 1492, Portuguese and Spanish entrepreneurs bloodily wrested control of Madeira, Cape Vert, Azores and the Canary islands. All these adventures were funded privately with the returns provided by the pillaging of natives and the establishment of sugar plantations.</p>
<p>Columbus participated in this trade industry, sailing north to Iceland and south to Senegal. He learned from the best, the Portuguese sailors, and became himself an expert in the new technologies enabling Atlantic voyages. Then he started dreaming of reaching a noble status, which at that time you could only achieve through feats of war or bold acts of exploration.</p>
<p>So he put together a half-cooked plan and started looking for funders and backers. He pitched and pitched, changing his story to suit his audience. And the audience was select, since only kings could help defend any gains from other rapacious kings. He tried Portugal, England and then Castille, where he was paid a salary to stick around and polish his plan. Today we call that an Entrepreneur In Residence.

<p>After seven years of fundraising, he signed a deal with the Catholic Kings who had just unified all the smaller kingdoms in Spain. This document, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitulations_of_Santa_Fe">Capitulations of Santa Fe</a>, is plain and simply a Term Sheet. Its main points are quite familiar to a modern entrepreneur:<br />* Columbus and his descendants would enjoy the title of Admiral of Castile (there you go, a noble! that meant huge perks and privileges in a post-feudal society)<br />* He'd also be the Viceroy and Governor of all the lands he discovered (today we call that CEO)<br />* A tenth of all the profits from trade and other enterprises (that'd be a 10% equity stake)<br />* The right to contribute up to an eighth of capital for any ensuing enterprises (an anti-dilution clause!)
<ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
<p>Once the deal was closed, the start-up got on to a full swing. The total capital deployed was equivalent to the annual income from a lowly noble person. The Crown provided about half, the other half coming from private investors, mostly Genovese financiers.</p>
<p>And off the three boats sailed, towards a direction no one had ever come back alive from (imagine the hiring interviews for the crew...). Columbus pulled it off though and pioneered a breakthrough route to the Indies, er, to the Americas. That sailing discovery started a grab for riches and eventually a huge trade industry between the two shores of the Atlantic ocean.</p>
<p>In pure start-up fashion, the story didn't end so well. Columbus was a gifted sailor but a terrible administrator. He fumbled the management of the conquered islands so badly that his own henchmen asked the King for a replacement. So the main shareholder, worried about the bottom line, organized a board coup and brought him back to Spain in chains, only to strip him of all his entitlements. For the following three centuries, Columbus' progeny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleitos_colombinos">fought the Crown in court</a> to recover their fair due, sadly to no avail...</p>
<p>This story holds a few lessons for today's entrepreneurs. First, we're very lucky to risk only our money and time, and never our lives. Second, our profession has been going on and on since Adam and Eve. Third, don't make deals with Kings!</p>
