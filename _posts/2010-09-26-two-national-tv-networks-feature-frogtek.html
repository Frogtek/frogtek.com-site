<p>This weekend has been a fantastic one for Frogtek's media coverage, with our product being covered in Spain's most important news program and also in Colombia's leading TV network.</p>
<p>As part of a longer piece on social entrepreneurs, our dear Guillermo was interviewed for the Telediario news program at TVE, the doyen of news reporting in Spain with an audience of millions of people. You can see our segment if you go to the 22nd minute of this <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/#886592">video</a>. Together with Frogtek, the piece featured <a href="http://www.ehas.org/index.php">EHAS</a>, which connects patients in the Amazonia with distant doctors using mobile phones and the internet.</p>
<p>Also very relevant was a <a href="http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/cienciaytecnologia/video-191573-ahora-los-tenderos-podran-manejar-su-negocio-el-celular">2:30 piece</a> covering our <a href="http://www.tiendatekweb.com/">Tiendatek</a> product in Caracol TV. We had the camera team come to Boris' shop, record our technology and interview everyone about the benefits of the software and the genesis of the idea. As a response, we are getting tens of emails of interest from shopkeepers all over Colombia!</p>
