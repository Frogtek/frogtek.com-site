<p>Metric for Microshops: Frogtek Wins $206,000 to Help Shopkeepers in Emerging Countries</p>
<p>By CIARA BYRNE of <a class="linkedGraphic" href="http://www.venturebeat.com/" target="_blank"><span class="venturebeat">VentureBeat</a><br />Published: September 16, 2011    </p>
<p> Spanish-American startup <a href="http://www.frogtek.org/">Frogtek </a>just won the biggest competition for European mobile startups, <a href="https://developer.vodafone.com/mobileclicks2011/">Vodafone Mobile Clicks</a>, with its app to help small shopkeepers in emerging markets run their businesses.</p>
<p>According to Frogtek, a Mexican stall-like, microretailer stocks an  average of 1000 products from 25 vendors and it is often managed with  nothing more sophisticated than a paper notebook. Frogtek wants to  change all that with the help of the $206,000 (150,000 EUR) prize.</p>
<p>The product consists of a bar code reader connected to a mobile  application running on an Android smart phone. Every product sold is  scanned and tracked by the application. This means that shopkeepers can,  often for the first time, track inventory, calculate daily sales,  identify best and worst selling products and order online from vendors.  Access to these simple metrics can be nothing short of revolutionary for  shopkeepers.</p>
<p> The inspiration for the product came  from micro credit agents in  Columbia who, 5 or 6 years ago, started using PDAs to record data from  credit rating interviews with applicants who ran shops. “For many of the  shopkeepers this was the first time they had seen their numbers” says  Frogtek CTO Guillermo Caudevilla. “And they said ‘I want something like  this for my business’”. Founder David de Ser heard about this project  and saw that since Android phones had become available he could make an  application accessible to these shopkeepers.        </p>
<p> The first market was Columbia, where Frogtek has run pilots for 2 years  and the startup hopes to be in 500 shops by the end of the year. Mexico  is now also a focus with 120 shops already up and running. According  to Caudevilla, 1 in 100 people in Mexico runs a shop and microretailers  are responsible for 5 percent of GDP. Worldwide there are more than 40  million microretailers.        </p>
<p> Microretailers are of great interest as distribution channels to large  vendors like Coca Cola and Procter and Gamble as well as banks, mobile  payment companies and micro-credit institutions. However, because of the  owners’ informal or non-existent accounting systems, accurate data on  their activities can be hard to come by. Frogtek’s business model is  based on selling that data as well as getting a commission on online  orders made via the application. Big companies will also often purchase  or subsidise the phone and bar code reader. “We are starting a trial in  Mexico with Coca Cola.” explains Caudevilla. ”We just signed an  agreement with the third biggest company in Columbia to have another  pilot and the second phase of that would aim to reach 120,000 shops in  Columbia within 5 years”.       </p>
<p> Subsidization is certainly necessary since the cost of the equipment,  $100 for the bar code reader and $200 for an Android smartphone, is  still prohibitive for most microretailers. The big challenge for Frogtek  in the future is therefore to create partnerships with large companies  who reach thousands of microretailers. Frogtek will use the prize money  to help grow the network of retailers and partners.        </p>
<p> Most of Frogtek’s competitors make applications on PCs for larger  retailers like minimarkets. “We are the only people doing this on a  phone which is 2 or 3 times cheaper. The application is completely  tailored to the needs that they have in emerging markets”  insists Caudevilla.       </p>
<p> A big issue for all social enterprises is how to measure their social  impact. Often they use a combination of breadth, the number of people  reached, and depth, the impact on individuals. When it comes to  gauging depth, Frogtek has an advantage. “We are making a measuring  tool.” Caudevilla says. “At some point we can measure if they are  selling more, reducing expenses, increasing margin, whether they have  given up selling bad products. What we are doing is giving these people  the power to make the best decisions.”        </p>
<p> Frogtek was founded in 2009. The 18 employees are based in Spain,  Columbia, Mexico and the United States and the company is current  angel-funded. One of the investors is <a href="http://www.stratphilanthropy.com/aboutus/josh-mailman.html">Josh Mailman</a>, the first investor in <a href="http://www.grameenphone.com/">Grameen Phone</a>, the biggest mobile operator in Bangladesh.        </p></p></p></p></p></p>
