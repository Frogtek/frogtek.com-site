<p>Our management team got together for a week in Bogot√°. We had a number of strategic topics to discuss and we spent two full days visiting some of the 70 shopkeepers that are using our product there. We wanted to know how they're liking our current version. And we took the opportunity to do some usability testing of our web portal with their performance reports. You can see a few pictures in the slideshow below.</p>

<p>The first store we visited was Damaris'. She was profiled in our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fob-u4b1z0c">video</a> for the Mobile World Congress competition and was very happy we had won the award. She was positively beaming when we showed her a news clip from a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuP2XmZHa6k">Spanish tv channel</a> where she appears.</p>
<p>But more importantly, she and her husband Diego explained to us why they like <a href="www.tiendatekweb.com">Tiendatek</a> so much. Before they started using it, they would track all sales in their notepad and then spend 3 hours in the evening updating an Excel spreadsheet with their inventory! That shows their discipline and we're happy they can save so much time with our product.</p>
<p>Tiendatek has also helped them secure a micro-loan and guide its deployment. As a result, the shop has grown significantly and the reports on the phone have helped them understand which products to keep and which ones to let go.</p>
<p>Damaris and Diego are two exceptional people that are using our product to its fullest advantage. It was very moving for us to realize how Tiendatek can help them translate their hard work into an opportunity to move ahead in life. Now we have to go out and find more shopkeepers like them!</p>
