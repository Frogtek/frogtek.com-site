<p>After a year of running Frogtek from New York City, I finally moved closer to our customers and markets this month. As of October 1st, my home address is in the exciting neighborhood of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_Condesa">La Condesa</a>, in the heart of Mexico City.</p>
<p>We have completed our first version of the <a href="http://www.tiendatekweb.com/">product</a> and I was feeling increasingly removed from the action back in nyc. As we shift into deployment mode and we negotiate distribution and partnership deals, it makes a lot of sense for me to be based in Mexico. Parachuting in and out is just not going to cut it at this point. So it's exciting to enter a new stage and being able to witness it first hand!</p>
