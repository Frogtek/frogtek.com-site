<p>It is well known that Moore's Law models the exponential growth in processing power and the exponential drop in its cost. IT technology is constantly getting cheaper and better at a fast clip. But it is harder to visualize the impact of that progress in the sales and prices of electronic gadgets.</p>
<p>The Washington Post has just created <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/a-gadgets-life/">a great visualization</a> that shows this effect in the most common gadgets we use:</p>
<div ><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_BjNr7UHXW8w/TTDmqKn3ebI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/KtpYWKdI5rM/s1600/Picture%2B1.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" height="400" width="378" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/Picture%2B1.png" /></a></div>
<p>You can clearly see the exponential growth in US sales of feature phones and the reduction in their price. In 1998, the average one cost $268 and 27M were sold. In 2008, these numbers were $112 and 102,8M. </p>
<p>From there on, sales started dropping. Why? Simple: smartphone sales were taking off. From less than 8M in 2005, sales have grown to 54M this past 2010. Meanwhile, the average price has dropped from $537 to $325.</p>
<p>That's a more drastic change than what we saw with feature phones. In my opinion, the reasons are the existence of honed distribution channels and the pull of the internet and apps. Since both causes are also present in emerging markets, I hope the spread of smartphones there will be even faster. And Google seems to think <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/12/14/andy-rubin-android-perfect-storm-brewing-in-emerging-markets/">the same way!</a></p>
