<p>Today I landed on a <a href="http://www.businessmodelalchemist.com/2010/08/combining-business-model-prototyping-customer-development-and-social-entrepreneurship.html">great post</a> by Alexander Osterwalder regarding the combination of his methodology for business model prototyping with the approach we follow at Frogtek of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steven-Blank/dp/0976470705">Customer Development</a>, as defined by <a href="http://steveblank.com/">Steve Blank</a>. The two come together very nicely, one providing the visuals to think through and understand complex scenarios, the other the rigourous approach to learn the facts and iterate accordingly. You could say that the former is the Kanban to the latter Agile Development, using a software analogy.</p>
<p>But the beauty of the post didn't end there. It used as a case study the example of <a href="http://www.peepoople.com/">Peepoople</a>, a social enterprise that brings a single-use toilet bag to the slums in Kenya. Here's an example of a potential business model (go <a href="http://www.businessmodelalchemist.com/tools">here</a> to understand the canvas):

<p>I was delighted to see how these leading thinkers, who are shaping new business practices, support the nascent field of social entrepreneurship as applied to the BOP. Steve Blank <a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/06/10/you%e2%80%99re-not-a-real-entrepreneur/">also wrote</a> about social entrepreneurship a while ago.</p>
<p>Please, keep these posts coming!!</p>
