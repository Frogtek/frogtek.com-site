<p>As soon as we had a workable prototype of our product TiendaTek, we looked for a handful of enthusiastic and outspoken shopkeepers that could help us with their feedback and ideas. These shopkeepers have been incredibly patient with our bugs and losses of data. And they have also been tremendously beneficial shaping the end product.</p>
<p>Now that we are getting ready for a commercial launch, two of them have stepped forward to join our Operations team. Given their shopkeeper background and their knowledge of the application, we are sure they will be great at sales and support!</p>
<p>So please welcome Harby (in the picture above) and Boris (in the video below, where he shows how he uses our phone app)!</p>
