We are very happy today as the [World Economic Forum](http://www.weforum.org/) has announced that our CEO, David del Ser, has been nominated a [Young Global Leader](http://www.weforum.org/young-global-leaders) in 2011:

_**Geneva, Switzerland**– The World Economic Forum has [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.weforum.org/news/world-economic-forum-announces-young-global-leaders-2011-latin-america) its Young Global Leaders (YGLs) for 2011\. The honour, bestowed each year by the Forum, recognizes and acknowledges up to 200 outstanding young leaders from around the world for their professional accomplishments, commitment to society and potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world.  
For 2011, the Forum has selected 190 Young Global Leaders from 65 countries and all stakeholders of society (business, civil society, social entrepreneurs, politics and government, arts and culture, and opinion and media). The new class represents all regions: East Asia (50), South Asia (18), Europe (42), Middle East and North Africa (13), sub-Saharan Africa (14), North America (37) and Latin America (16). This year’s selection has more gender parity than ever, with 44% women._
