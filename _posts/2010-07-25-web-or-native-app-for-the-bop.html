<p><a href="http://www.mobileactive.org/">Mobileactive</a> recently wrote a very well-researched <a href="http://mobileactive.org/mobile-web-not-apps">blog post</a> comparing the benefits and disadvantages of delivering content through a mobile website versus an application. As smartphones proliferate, content producers need to decide whether they want to cater to their audiences one way or another (or both) and the article makes a good case for mobile Web content.</p>
<p>However their analysis is not focused on emerging markets, where data connections tend to be slow and pricey. And more importantly, it also leaves outside the case of software tools that are designed to perform tasks interactively instead of distributing content. We believe that in these two cases native apps provide a much better alternative.</p>
<p>Through our work in Mexico and Colombia at the BOP, we have painfully learned how unreliable the mobile data connections can be, even in urban areas. That turns the mobile web into a distant aspiration, as mobile browsers today need a connection to render content. In contrast, a native app can be designed to store information to be uploaded when a connection becomes available. That added flexibility comes very handy with spotty networks. This approach also economizes on bandwidth, as graphics and the user interface can be found locally and only vital information is exchanged with the server.</p>
<p>And if what you are building is a productive tool and not a content consumption method, native apps win hands on. As mobileactive's article already notes, the more user engagement and features you need, the more a native app is the right choice. Accessing a local database and getting barcodes from a reader can only be done by a native app.</p>
<p>Finally, a typical BOP user doesn't have the luxury of a laptop to complement a smartphone for the more demanding tasks. If the smartphone is the only computing device available, the user will need the full-fledged experience that only native apps can offer.</p>
<p>So we believe that the mobile web will be less important to BOP users than mobile apps, given the conditions of data networks and the need for productive engagement.</p>
<p>In time technology will  synthesize and eliminate this dichotomy: you can already insert mobile pages within a native app, as we are doing with our Tiendatek. This will allow the software designer to combine the best elements of each approach according to the particular goal at hand.</p>
