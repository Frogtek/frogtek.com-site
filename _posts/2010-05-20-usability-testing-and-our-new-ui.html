<div >Three weeks ago we did our first complete series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing">Usability Testing</a> with new shopkeepers. We basically gave them no training or help while we were asking them to complete simple tasks like making a Sale on Credit or Registering a Rent Expense. The shopkeepers were a mix of young and old, male and female.</div>
<div ></div>
<div >It was a very humbling experience. We watched in awe while they took a long time for the simplest tasks. They got stuck in numerous occasions. They didn't understand what a lot of buttons were supposed to do. They found some of the texts misleading. All in all, a pretty shocking test for us.</div>
<div ></div>
<div >The good news was that most of the confusion was due to superficial obstacles, although some core tasks had to be rebuilt from scratch. The bad news was that we had a ton of work just to get the current features to a usable level...</div>
<div ></div>
<div >If that wasn't enough, we supplemented the UX Testing with a round of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</a>, which made us go through a comprehensive list of best practices to detect interface problems. That uncovered another long list of interface issues.</div>
<div ></div>
<div >So for the past three weeks we have been focusing on revamping the look and feel of the application. You can judge the results with the new Main Screen, we are very happy!</div>

<div >The exercise has proven really valuable. Now the application is clearly improved on a key aspect, as our target customers are not the most computer-savvy. And we have learned a powerful trick to keep the user in the center of our work. I can proudly congratulate the team for turning this around so well and so quickly!</div>
