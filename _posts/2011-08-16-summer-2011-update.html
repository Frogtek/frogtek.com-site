<p>Two Years and Counting...<br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/DamarisDiego_withTiendatek.jpg"  height="119" width="125" />There are different ways to measure the age of a company -- for example, from when the founder had the original idea, the first dollar spent or the date of legal incorporation. However, the definition we use most is when we received investment because that is when we ramped up our learning via hiring a team, turning protypes into market-ready products and spending every day with our customers. That date was two years ago this month.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/ReformaTiendatek1.jpg"  height="100" width="86" />While many challenges lie ahead, we're proud of our accomplishments so far. First and foremost, our product <a href="http://app.streamsend.com/c/14404965/182/1Tqs3OX/afMP?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiendatekweb.com" target="_blank">Tiendatek </a>has repeatedly and demonstrably helped our users to improve the profitability of their businesses. As a social venture this goal is core to everything we do. Second, by demonstrating value to companies and other organizations we are deploying phones more quickly and efficiently via new collaborations. As a for-profit company these partnerships help us scale in a repeatable way. Third, our team, culture and processes have fostered any environment where we continuously innovate. As people this makes Frogtek an exciting place to work.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without friends and supporters like you so we want to thank you again for the last two years and the many, many more to come.</p>

<p>Collaboration with FEMSA Coca-Cola in Mexico Kicks Off<br />
<br /></p>
<p>We are now working closely with FEMSA, the largest bottler for Coca-Cola in Latin America, to deploy Tiendatek in Mexico City. FEMSA regularly visits their best retail partners to provide a range of consulting services and negotiate prices and as part of this program they are now offering Tiendatek as a value-added service. To date the feedback from shopkeepers has been enormously positive and we are delivering phones with our software every week to new users.</p>

<p>Customer Spotlight: Using Information to Give More Power to Shopkeepers<br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/phone_tiendatek_pro.jpg"  height="182" width="84" />Nearly every day we get feedback from our users about how Tiendatek has helped them to improve their businesses and we want to start sharing more of these stories.</p>
<p>In the case of Sara, a shopkeeper in Mexico, one anecdote in particular illustrates how Tiendatek has given her more power when negotiating with suppliers. A couple of months ago a salesperson was pushing a group of products so he could make his own quotas but through the Tiendatek reports Sara noticed that one of these items was not selling well. When Sara decided not to buy this product, the provider got upset and stopped his visits entirely, leading Sara to call his supervisor. The supervisor was so flabbergasted that he came to Sara's store personally to apologize and assure her that sales visits would re-start immediately (and we hope he scolded the salesman).</p>
<p>This example about the democratization of market data not only empowers the shopkeeper, it also improves the supply chain by better aligning supply with demand and ensuring that products do not simply sit on a shelf collecting dust. <br />

<p>Operations Team Grows in Mexico and Colombia<br />
<br /></p>
<p>We have grown the Operations teams in Mexico and Colombia to help roll out Tiendatek as well as provide additional training and support to our users.<br />
