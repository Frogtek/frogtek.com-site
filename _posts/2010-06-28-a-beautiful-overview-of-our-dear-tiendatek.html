<p>For a while we have had different demos of our product Tiendatek in youtube. But Kristel, our fantastic graphic designer and multimedia queen, has put together a phenomenal overview video designed to greet the shopkeepers that buy our product.</p>
<p>We are now working on a set of tutorial videos that explain how to conduct the key operations on the phone like making a sale or a purchase, register an expense and see the financial reports. The goal is to have a simple and self-explaining product that brings with it all the training needed to operate it. </p>
<p>The shopkeepers will then buy the product, open the box, watch the videos and get started without any further human interaction. We're still a while away from that but getting closer!</p>
