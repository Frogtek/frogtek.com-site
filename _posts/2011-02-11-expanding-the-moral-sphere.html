<p>Two weeks ago <a href="http://www.echoinggreen.org">Echoing Green</a> held its annual conference for all its Fellows. It was a great break to get together with friends and fellow social entrepreneurs, learn about each other's exciting developments and strengthen the bonds of a fantastic community.</p>
<p>As part of the weekend activities, EG hosted a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/echoinggreen1#g/c/EC79D055D0943C35">Be Bold Summit</a> with ten presentations at a beautiful venue in UT's campus. I was invited to speak and decided to focus on the history of social entrepreneurship through a concept borrowed from Peter Singer: the expanding moral sphere.<br />Here you can see a video with the complete chat:</p>
