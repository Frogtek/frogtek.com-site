<p>Accounting gets a bad rep for being dry and boring. Fair enough. But if you dig into its purpose and history, you can find a fascinating story. With the proviso that I am no historian, I wanted to offer a glimpse at how many innovations have been spurred by the need to account properly.

<p>Let's start at the very beginning. Human populations have always traded with their neighbors but when they settled down in growing villages, their trade routes lengthened and the amount of goods exchanged grew. The solution was to craft pottery jars that could hold and preserve the goods while on transit. But when you had 100 jars, how did you know what each of them contained? Traders had to invent writing to account for their wares. Believe it or not, accountants were the ones that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_signs#Meaning_of_the_symbols">invented writing</a> systems (poets were still memorizing their verses).</p>
<p>Of course, numbers and other mathematical constructs had a direct application to ac-counting from the very beginning. Trigonometry can be handy while calculating how much grain a given plot will yield. Algebra apparently received a powerful impetus from the complexity of the Arabic inheritance laws.&nbsp;Even the hindi-arabic numerals came to Europe through accountants: Fibonacci wrote the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_Abaci">Liber Abaci</a>&nbsp;in 1202 to show how bookkeeping would be enhanced with the new numbers, advocating for their introduction.

<p>Double-entry accounting took a bit longer. While already in use by Venetian traders in the 1200s, we had to wait until 1494 for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli">Luca Pacioli</a> to write the first formal treatise on bookkeeping and thus formalize double-entry accounting as we know it today.</p>
<p>To keep this post short, let's fast-forward to the computer age. Initially, programmable computers were huge and designed for the military and big universities. But guess what, the first company to take the invention private was J. Lyons, a British catering company that built the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEO_computer#Applications_and_successors">LEO I</a> to manage payroll and inventory.</p>
<p>As the price of computers dropped, there was a quick evolution and all the major corporations purchased mainframes to help their bookkeepers. SAP, Oracle and other huge companies are still innovating in this industry. Later, with software like Intuit's <a href="http://www.quickbooks.com/">Quickbooks</a>, even small businesses and individuals with a PC could get the benefits of someone dumber but faster doing their numbers.</p>
<p>Today, accounting is fully democratized among the businesses in the rich world. However, that's not true with the informal businesses in the developing world: the micro-entrepreneurs. Lacking computer applications, the best of them struggle with paper-based methods that are less powerful than Luca Pacioli's. That stymies their progress as it makes their operation harder to manage and less likely to get financed.

<p>Luckily, all micro-entrepreneurs already have a computer in their hands: the cell phone. As soon as their interfaces improve and their power grows, their phones will turn smart and will be put to work as accounting tools.</p>
<p>Our belief at Frogtek is that it will take another computer paradigm shift through a combination of <a href="http://blog.frogtek.org/2011/03/shifting-computing-paradigms.html">mobile phones and cloud servers</a>&nbsp;for these informal businesses to&nbsp;adopt accounting&nbsp;. That is the reason we are building <a href="http://www.tiendatekweb.com/">Tiendatek</a>&nbsp;on Android and with a connection to the cloud. Hopefully millions and millions of micro-entrepreneurs will become our happy users in the next few years!</p>
