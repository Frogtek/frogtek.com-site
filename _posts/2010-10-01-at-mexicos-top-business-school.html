<p>Yesterday Yael and I attended a very interesting lecture given by Edmundo Vallejo, a former LatAm CEO at GE that is now a professor at <a href="http://www.ipade.mx/">Ipade</a>, Mexico's foremost business school. Ipade organizes an annual refresher for former alumni and Edmundo's presentation was focused on the aftermath of the economic crisis.<br />The room was full of senior managers from large organizations hailing from the spectrum of Mexican industries. Edmundo wanted to give them a taste of the new trends in global business, from cloud computing to strategic partnerships to crowdsourcing and the base of the pyramid.<br />To our relish, he used Frogtek's example to thread a number of disparate concepts together. He provided a masterful description of our business model, which you can see in the picture above (I'm so stealing his slides!). Afterwards Yael and I took the floor to answer a few questions from the audience.<br />It was hard to believe our young company held any lessons for such an experienced crowd. But with a Professor like Edmundo, anything is possible!</p>
