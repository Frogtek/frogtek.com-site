<p>Alan Haberman did not invent the barcode but was the chief responsible person for its wide adoption in its current form. He passed away recently and the New York Times dedicated him a glowing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/business/16haberman.html">obituary</a>:

<blockquote><p >Today, trillions of beeps later, what was once a novel technology with uncertain prospects is so widespread as to be almost invisible. It informs nearly every aspect of modern life, providing a means for people to buy and sell things, couriers to track packages and airlines to locate (in principle, anyway) lost luggage.</p>
<p >This transformation, industry experts say, is largely because of the work of one person, a supermarket executive from Massachusetts named Alan L. Haberman, who died on Sunday at 81.</p>

<p ><meta charset="utf-8" /><span class="Apple-style-span" >Barcodes underpin our prosperous society by injecting efficiency in so many different ways. They have spread worldwide and can be found on almost all the packaged products consumed anywhere. </p>
<p ><span class="Apple-style-span" >We take barcodes for granted but there are still millions of shops who fail to benefit from them. Almost 40 years after the standard was set by Mr Haberman, the vast majority of small retailers in emerging markets don't have scanners. It is a bit of a tragedy, as 80-90% of the products they sell could be scanned and thus better managed.</p>
<p ><span class="Apple-style-span" >Hopefully our Tiendatek and other systems from competitors will help bridge this gap and quickly spread the joyful beeps far and wide!</p>
