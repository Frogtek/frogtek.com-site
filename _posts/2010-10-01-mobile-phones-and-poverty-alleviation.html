<p><i><span class="Apple-style-span" ><span class="Apple-style-span" >This is reblogged from a <a href="http://columbiasocialenterprise.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/do-cell-phones-help-alleviate-poverty/">post I wrote</a> for Columbia Business School's blog on the Social Enterprise Conference:</i></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" >Technology has a critical role to play in economic development. After all, together with education, it is what makes humans more productive. That is the reason why the phenomenal spread of mobile phones globally has created so much enthusiasm and hope.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" >The mobile operators, intrigued by the success of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.grameenphone.com/index.php?id=79" >Grameen Phone Village Ladies</a>, have done a remarkable job at reaching everyone, everywhere. Basic phones are now ubiquitous and can be taken for granted while designing social schemes. Thanks to a dense network of distributors and resellers, mobile minutes can be bought electronically at your next-door store. And in lucky countries like Kenya, you can even send Mom some money through the wildly successful&nbsp;<a href="http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=745" >mPesa</a>.</p>
<p>These new opportunities are not going unnoticed, and social entrepreneurs are bringing their start-up innovation in full force. For instance, in Colombia&nbsp;<a href="http://dinastica.com/COMPANIAS/TAXI911/index.html" >you can text</a>&nbsp;a cab’s license plate to Taxi 911, and they’ll tell you if it is registered and give you an instant insurance policy to boot. Or you can upload your resume to&nbsp;<a href="http://empleolisto.com/" >EmpleoListo</a>&nbsp;and be notified over SMS about any job match.</p>
<p>The future brings even more promise. As we go from simple phones limited to voice and text messages to Swiss-army smartphones, what applications will be created by social entrepreneurs? If you look at the Silicon Valley, one trend is clear: the integration of services unlocks tremendous amounts of value. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and most new start-ups offer ways for other developers to connect into their services and platforms. As an example, you can see what your Facebook friends are reading on the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. And Google ads have powered many business models by being inserted into someone else’s web pages.</p>
<p>Surely social applications can also lever each other to produce richer services too. For instance, a person in Nicaragua could find a dream job with EmpleoListo and also receive his salary on his phone, no bank account necessary. Or a Taxi 911 app could show a map with the riskiest corners to grab a cab in Bogotá and send your GPS coordinates to the police.</p>
<p>Intrigued by the possibilities? Entrepreneurs in this space will brainstorm at Columbia Business School’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/students/organizations/sec/conference2010/index.htm" >Social Enterprise Conference</a>. Join us for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/students/organizations/sec/conference2010/schedule.htm#4c" >panel</a>&nbsp;that will explore how to build a regional system to distribute, control, and pay for medicines and other basic goods in Kenya. All that, of course, using a lot of mobile phones.</p>
