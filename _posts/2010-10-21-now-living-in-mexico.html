<p>After two years running Frogtek from New York, I have now officially relocated to Mexico City. With the shopkeeper product ready for deployment, it is important that I come close to the users. This is particularly important as we start the iteration of our business model and engage our corporate customers/partners like the microfinance institutions and the large consumer goods companies.</p>
<p>So at the end of last month my dear Jane and I packed our nyc lives and brought them to this fabulous city. We found a cute apartment in La Condesa, a nice neighborhood with parks and a public bike scheme. And now we'll start getting used to the city's huge scale and bumpy rhythms. Hopefully we'll soon feel like locals (I'm working on my accent!).</p>
<p>My favorite finding so far about Mexico DF: in the 17th century some powerful rains flooded the city under 9 feet of water. More impressive still, the city stayed flooded for five years!! The king almost relocated the thriving capital but in the end all the real-estate owners prevailed and kept it put. Crazy!</p>
