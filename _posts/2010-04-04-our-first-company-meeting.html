<p>Frogtek finally had a meeting with all the great people working on this adventure (we missed Kristel
    though...). It was a really fun time getting to know better all those voices in the skype calls. And we
    also worked hard to draft the strategy of the company for the next year.</p>
<p>We talked about the different offices and about the way the engineering team works, with its kanban board
    and other agile techniques. And we discusses usability testing and its related design techniques that
    we're working hard to implement.</p>
<p>Of course, there was time for other things like visiting the jewels of Huesca: the <a

        href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anvica/4416652257/">Mallos of Riglos</a>, the monastery of <a
        href="http://www.monasteriosanjuan.com/monasterio-san-juan-de-la-pena.php?L=en">San Juan de la
    Pe√±a</a>. </p>
<p>It was re-energizing to get together and appreciate the shared enthusiasm for Frogtek's mission. Now it's
    time to turn that motivation into steps forward by reaching more and more shopkeepers!</p>
