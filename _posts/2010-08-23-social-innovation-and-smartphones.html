<p>In this past weeks The Economist has written a couple of articles that I wanted to mention. In the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16789766">first one</a>, they discuss Obama's Social Innovation fund and similar efforts out of the UK. Both mostly focus on domestic issues and show the great progress being made in the field. It is fantastic that these approaches are reaching the Economist's wide audience, hopefully soon we'll read about international topics.</p>

<p>The second article covered the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16846524?story_id=16846524&amp;fsrc=rss">spread of smartphones</a> in South East Asia, fostered by competition on mobile calls that have reduced the revenues per user. This is very good news for Frogtek, as it shows that the relatively poor are being chased by the big operators and handset manufacturers. In turn, that trend should bring down the prices of hardware and data plans.</p>
<p>What The Economist didn't discuss is what the poor will do with those smartphones. They'll obviously consume media and entertainment like everyone else. And they'll also communicate in a frenzy, now that everyone's on Facebook.</p>
<p>But will they also put the phones to productive uses, for instance to help their micro-businesses? We surely hope so!</p>
