<p>When we first thought about the most likely users for our product, we zeroed in on young males as more techie and thus willing to adopt our innovation. Well, as we have grown the network of users, we have seen that gender plays a very little role in the process. There are actually more women than men currently running their shop with our product! So much for preconceptions...</p>
<p>Below you can hear some of those female shopkeepers as they talk about our Tiendatek product and what they like about it. The prize for social impact goes to Damaris, who got her latest loan by showing her financial information on her phone to the credit officer at the microfinance institution.</p>
