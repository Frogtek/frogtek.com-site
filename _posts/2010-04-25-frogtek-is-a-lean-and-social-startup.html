<p>This last friday the Lean Startup movement had its inaugural conference in San Francisco. Called <a href="http://www.sllconf.com/">Startup Lessons Learned</a>, it gathered an impressive roster of practitioners and proponents of this leaner way of launching ventures, using less capital and focused sharply on the customer.</p>
<p>The movement is gathering steam and has grown tremendously since <a href="http://steveblank.com/">Steve Blank</a> started teaching his Customer Development methodology out of his Four Steps to Epiphany <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steven-Blank/dp/0976470705">book</a>. A mentee of his, Eric Ries, coined the term Lean Startup and has <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">blogged</a> repeatedly about the techniques to apply it to software companies. Today the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/business/25unboxed.html?th&emc=th">New York Times</a> wrote about it, marking a decided step into the mainstream of tech businesses.</p>
<p>At Frogtek we have been avid readers of their wise articles and fully appreciate the clarity the methodology brings to our social startup endeavor. Focusing on the customer and spending lots of time "outside of the lab" talking to shopkeepers is crucial for us. All product developers need to understand their customer. But since we are working with customers at the BOP but were not raised in it, we have to make an extra effort to get in their shoes and see the world from their point of view.</p>
<p>So we are very grateful for this pioneering work that shines light on the right metrics and approaches as we move forward. We believe the methodology also applies to non-technological scenarios where the problems are poorly understood and the solutions unknown. This very much applies to all social enterprises!</p>
