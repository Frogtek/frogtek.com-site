<p>Yesterday I read a <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/07/some-thoughts-on-the-seed-fund-phenomenon.html">very interesting post</a> by <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/about.html">Fred Wilson</a>, a prominent VC specialized in web and mobile start-ups (his fund has invested in stars like Twitter, Zynga of Farmville's fame and Foursquare, to name a few). Although he was focused on seed funds, to me the most relevant point he makes is that technology companies require less and less capital to get started and to prove their merit:</p>

<p>This is a welcome change, as successful entrepreneurial teams get to keep more equity and the investors run less risk. It also tilts the balance of power towards the founders and away from investors (see the Foursquare example in Fred's post).</p>
<p>The main reasons for this great shift is the increased availability of open and often free platforms to build web and mobile products. For instance, at Frogtek we are using Android (free and open-source!) to build our <a href="http://www.tiendatekweb.com/">mobile point of sale</a>, and we are using Google App Engine (free under a generous threshold of activity) for our web components, including hosting and servers somewhere in the Cloud. All this means we get to experiment and build a functioning product without any technology investments beyond Mac computers and some affordable <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6csD1P1fIUk&amp;feature=related">workflow tools</a>.</p>
<p>It is great that this structural change is lowering the entry bar for rich world start-ups selling to rich world consumers. But it could have an even happier impact on tech start-ups that cater to the poor such as ourselves. Not only the experimentation phase is cheaper and faster, also the operational costs are lowered, which is great news when you're serving low-income consumers.</p>
<p>Finally, this shift is also making the first steps easier for start-ups located in emerging economies, as all these platforms are available anywhere on the planet (mostly). With the parallel and fast diffusion of mobile phones in those markets, the future is bright for those who want to build local solutions to local problems using the best technology the world has to offer. We'll definitely be paying attention!</p>
