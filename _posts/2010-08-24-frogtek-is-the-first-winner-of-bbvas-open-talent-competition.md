We are thrilled to announce that out of more than 400 entries from around the world, we are the [first winner in BBVA's Open Talent competition](http://app.streamsend.com/c////?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbvaopentalent.com%2Ffrogtek-es-el-primero-de-los-ganadores-de-la-segunda-edicion-de-bbva-open-talent%2F)! [BBVA](http://app.streamsend.com/c////?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbva.com) is a leading Spanish bank that operates extensively throughout Latin America, and with the financial and institutional support valued at â‚¬100,000 we will distribute our [TiendaTek product](http://app.streamsend.com/c////?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiendatekweb.com) to shopkeeper clients of [BancaMia](http://app.streamsend.com/c////?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bancamia.com.co%2F), one of the largest microfinance institutions in Colombia and partly owned by BBVA. 

As part of this project we will develop mobile educational and marketing tools to help both shopkeepers and BancaMia improve their respective businesses as well as strengthen their relationship. We are honored by the award and look forward to a long and fruitful partnership with BBVA.
