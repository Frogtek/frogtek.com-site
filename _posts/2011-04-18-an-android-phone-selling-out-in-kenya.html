<p><a href="http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=1023">Safaricom</a>, of well-deserved mPesa fame, has started promoting Android aggressively in Kenya. They teamed up with Huawei to distribute their Ideos phone, which is an entry level Android phone selling for $100 bundled with 600MBs (we're jealous here in Mexico, both phones and data plans are more expensive...)</p>
<p>Apparently the phones are selling out as the demand has outstripped expectations. 2000 Ideos are being sold per day, with 50,000 sold so far. Kenya has thus become a <a href="http://www.kenyandroid.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=158">hot market</a> for smartphones, in some ways surpassing South Africa.</p>
<p>Let's hope other mobile operators decide to tap this market and turn the smartphone into a mass consumer device!</p>
