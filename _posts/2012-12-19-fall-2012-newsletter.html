<p>Introducing TiendatekData, Our Market Research Tool<br />
<img  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/Picture1.png" alt="" width="176" height="109" />We have begun producing, marketing and selling market research data from our network of shopkeepers. Our shopkeepers are now registering over 75,000 sales per week through our technology and we have packaged this data into interactive reports that consumer packaged goods companies and others can review in real time. You can see a demo <a href="http://www.tiendatekdata.com/" target="_blank">here </a>(in Spanish). Please contact us via <a href="http://www.tiendatekdata.com/">www.tiendatekdata.com</a> if you are interested in learning more.</p>
<p>New Projects with Unilever and Grupo Bimbo in Mexico<br  /><img class="alignleft"  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/Bimbo_Unilever.png" alt="" width="140" height="73" />We are now working with the sales teams of Unilever and Grupo Bimbo in Mexico to roll out <a href="http://www.tiendatekweb.com" target="_blank">Tiendatek </a>to new stores. Sales agents from each company are promoting Tiendatek to their best clients and passing those leads on to us. In exchange, the sales agents receive prizes and we are sending free market research to their marketing departments for a limited time period. These partnerships have already proved to be a very cost-effective way of growing our network as well as generating interest in our data products and services.</p>
<p>Looking for Technology Investors <br />
We are looking for investors with technology expertise to include in our next financing round. Shopkeepers are at the center of everything we do but we also connect to them through our Android applications and cloud servers and when implemented at the scale we are planning it is a significant technical challenge. If you know of any investor that could be a good fit please let us know. To make things easier we have created a profile on <a href="https://angel.co/frogtek" target="_blank">Angel List</a>. Please follow us!</p>
<p>Record Sales Push in Mexico <br  /><img  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/TendatekMexico.jpg" alt="" width="173" height="116" />In September we set aggressive sales goals for our operations team and knicknamed the push the "Septiembre de Grito" (September Yell). The results surpassed our expectatations: 77 new contracts signed, 59 product deliveries and a lot of new learnings. Most of our Mexico team is pictured above.</p>

<p>Operations in Colombia Expand <br  /><img  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/CTS2.png" alt="" width="150" height="55" />We have expanded our partnership with Carvajal Tecnología y Servicios in Colombia to the city of Cali where we are now working with a leading microfinance institution (Women's World Banking) as well as Carvajal's foundation (Fundación Carvajal). In this new phase we are delivering Tiendatek to shopkeepers that are already part of the Fundación Carvajal network with the goal of transforming them into virtual branches of Women's World Banking.</p>
<p>Frogtek in the News <br />
We continue to be fortunate and receive numerous mentions in both the press and social enterprise community. Perhaps most prominently, Iniciativa Mexico <a href="http://www.iniciativamexico.org/audiovisual/tienda-tek/" target="_blank">created a video</a> about our work which has led to hundreds of calls and emails after being shown on television. We were also <a href="http://ibmsmartcamp.com/2012/10/04/5-finalists-announced-for-smartcamp-mexico-city-kickstart/" target="_blank">one of five finalists</a> in IBM's Smart Camp in Mexico City last month. Lastly, we were profiled in the <a href="http://www.reforma.com/libre/online07/preacceso/articulos/default.aspx?plazaconsulta=reforma&amp;url=http://www.reforma.com/interfase/articulo/678/1354705/&amp;urlredirect=http://www.reforma.com/interfase/articulo/678/1354705/?titulo=ideas-mexicanas-que-valen-millones" target="_blank">Mexican newspaper <em>Reforma</em></a>. </p>
