<p>Now that our product is ready for playtime, we have to experiment with different ways to reach shopkeepers to see what works best. In that regard, we are extremely happy to count with Coca-Cola's support in Mexico. They have worked with us to develop the ad below for Tiendatek, which includes an implicit Coca Cola endorsement through the use of their logo.</p>

<p>The ad will appear on Coca-Cola's national magazine, with an audience of&nbsp;68,000 of their most dedicated shopkeepers all over the country. We're looking for 100 to get started, hopefully we get more than enough responses.</p>
<p>The ad was put together by Kristel, our wonderful graphic designer, with help from others. We think it will resonate with shopkeepers both graphically and textually, would you have any suggestions about it?</p>
