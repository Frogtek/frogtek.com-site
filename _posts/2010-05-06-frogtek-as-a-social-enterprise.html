<p>As any rising field or approach, the social enterprise one struggles to find a good definition for its essence. <a href="http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/socialenterprise/about/meaningse">Academics</a> and <a href="http://www.echoinggreen.org/about/what-is-social-entrepreneurship">leaders</a> in the field try to substitute the "I know it when I see it" approach of practitioners by crafting categories and distilling the enormous variety in the actual world. It is a worthwhile effort that tries to preserve the substance in the name, which risks erosion and fluffiness if everyone and anyone uses it.</p>
<p>Recently in a Columbia business school class, a student in the audience asked what made Frogtek a social enterprise. I answered that there are two broad types of entrepreneurial start-ups, those who have a solution and are looking for a problem, and those who know of a problem and are looking for a solution to it.</p>
<p>I believe social entrepreneurs specialize in a particular type of problem: those that have unjust social or environmental consequences. They start with a complex ill and labor hard and long to develop a solution, hopefully one that could scale to a meaningful level.</p>
<p>In Frogtek's case, we are puzzled by the sad irony within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_penalty">poverty penalty</a>: why do poor people have to pay more money than the rich for the exact same product?</p>
<p>There's no simple answer but the main reason is that the distribution channels that serve the poor are more expensive. In the case of food and basic household goods, a key culprit is the inefficient operation of the corner shopkeeper. Herself a low-income entrepreneur, the shopkeeper has no clear idea or right tool to run her business in a more efficient way. In the end, she earns less money and has to charge higher prices...</p>
<p>Now, back to working hard so our technology can help shopkeepers and their communities!</p>
