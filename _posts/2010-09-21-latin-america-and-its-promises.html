<p>A few days ago The Economist ran a <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16964114?story_id=16964114">special report</a> on Latin America's remarkable economic performance over the last ten years. For the first time in living memory, it has weathered the recession better than other Western countries including the US. And from 2002 to 2008, the region grew at 5.5%. Countries like Peru are actually taking off at tiger rates of 9% and above. The happy consequence is that tens of millions of people have escaped poverty and are joining the vibrant lower-middle class.<br />That hopeful picture is what we constantly see in our work in Mexico and Colombia. Micro-entrepreneurs are witnessing a general improvement around them and feel optimistic enough to borrow money from microfinance institutions, in effect making a bet on a more prosperous future.<br />The report also highlights the low productivity found in the region, linked strongly to the vast informal sector. We couldn't agree more, but at the same time we get excited by the opportunity to boost that productivity. We believe the IT-led boom in the rich service economies will be replicated in the informal sector in Latin America. But it will happen on the back of the new mobile and cloud computing platforms, as micro-entrepreneurs leapfrog over PCs.<br />We will surely love to join in that tremendous improvement!</p>
